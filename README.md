This data visualization piece by Pitch Interactive uses the text of the Bible and the Quran to compare the frequency of words. It is split into three vertical sections - one for the Old Testament, one for the New Testament, and one for the Quran. It is very interactive visualization. The user can type in a word they are curious about, decide if they want the program to also take into account synonyms, and then look at the word counts. The wave-like swell gives an easy to understand idea of quanitity, and when the mouse hovers over a particular item, the verse reference and text appear, so the user can see the word in context.

This visualization, made by the Office for Creative Research, was a request from the publishers of Popular Science magazine. The creators used PopSci's 138 years of published material to show how different technical and cultural terms have come in and out of use in the magazine since it began. There is great subtlety in this piece - the colors of the atoms come from the cover of the issue it refers to, and the size comes from the number of words in the issue. This visualization creates interesting overlapping and cascading word chains, using highly modern methods, but still retaining a historical, time-old feel.
